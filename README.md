# SQL-Project-Sports Tournament Database
ðŸ“Œ **Why I Chose This Project**
I wanted to build a real-world database project using a topic I'm familiar withâ€”IPL. 
Cricket is popular and easy to relate to, so I used IPL 2025 match data to design a project that helped me practice SQL, database design, and data analysis.

âœ… **What I Did**

Created a database to track IPL 2025 matches, players, and team stats
Designed 4 tables: Teams, Players, Matches, and Stats
Inserted real team names and match winners from IPL 2025
Added sample data for player performance (runs and wickets)
Wrote SQL queries to get match results, top scorers, and team points
Used JOINs, GROUP BY, CTEs and aggregate functions.

ðŸ“˜ **What I Learned**

How to create and link multiple tables using foreign keys
How to use JOINs to connect tables and get meaningful results
How to write aggregate queries (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
How to analyze sports data like player runs, match wins, etc.
How to use SQL for building a small project that feels real and useful

ðŸ’¡ **Project Summary**

This project helped me understand how to:
Design a database from scratch
Store and analyze structured data
Use SQL practically beyond just SELECT statements
Build reports like leaderboards and match summaries

ðŸ›  **Tools Used**

MySQL for database and queries
